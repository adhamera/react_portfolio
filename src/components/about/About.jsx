          <h1> About Me. </h1>
          <h2> <span>Pre-Medical Student</span> Turned <span>Software Engineer.</span></h2>
          <p>Hello, I'm Anusha, a Software Engineer based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Previously, I was a pre-medical student and research assistant. I decided to pivot to tech when I felt unfulfilled with my job in direct patient care. Reflecting on my interests ignited my curiousity for tech. Soon after, I joined my first coding bootcamp with Trilogy Education where I learned front-end frameworks such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I was hooked. Eager to learn more, I quickly jumped at the opportunity to join Hackbright Academy's Target-sponsored programming fellowship. At Hackbright, I learned Python and built my first full-stack application, Plantlet. I am currently a TTS intern at Target. As a software engineer, my goals are to make the world a more efficient place and empower women and POC in tech. When I am not programming, you can find me hiking the Minnesotan trails, enjoying a good book or spending time with my two year-old cat, Ace.</p>
